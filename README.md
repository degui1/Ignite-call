# ðŸš€ Ignite Call - Next ðŸš€

Ignite call is a scheduling app, where the user can register on the website, connect with their Google account and provide a scheduling link to their clients and/or friends. 

Those who receive the link can choose an available day and time from the registered user's calendar.

Automatically, when making a schedule, information with date, time, name, email and notes are added to the Google calendar of the user who provided the access link to their schedule screen. The available days and times are defined when registering.
